* Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
* PHP Conditional Statements

* Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

* In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

    * if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
    * if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
    * if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions

* Syntax:

    if (condition) {
    code to be executed if condition is true;
    } 

* The if...else Statement

* The if...else statement executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false.
* Syntax:

    if (condition) {
    code to be executed if condition is true;
    } else {
    code to be executed if condition is false;
    } 

*The if...elseif...else statement executes different codes for more than two conditions.
*Syntax:

    if (condition) {
        code to be executed if this condition is true;
    } elseif (condition) {
        code to be executed if first condition is false and this condition is true;
    } else {
        code to be executed if all conditions are false;
    }
